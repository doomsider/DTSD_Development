DTSD_Development
================

The next development cycle for DTSD .17

Goals:
Find bugs
Implement new features
Code review for readability, continuity, logic, and speed


Some ideas feel free to add:

Add ability to claim and name sectors with player owned bases.  Give residual income or some other perks.

Add sector events like random encounters, missions, and boss fights.  Perhaps look to replace the existing enemy AI altogther for now

Add ability to gather statistics for the server such as players on, size of directory, memory usage, player info, etc 
  to be used for access by other web applications or as a status display for a screen.

Add a management panel option with the use of tmux to offer a display of the current log, chat, statistics/status of server
  and allow player to interact with the server with hotkeys
  
Add a mass export option to export all sectors with ships, stations, and planets for backup and restoration
