Goals:
Create a queue system for functions in logging
Create new file system to store all entities into single files (ie A player file that contains all players)
Create a script/function that can be ran to change server.cfg, block files, daemon.cfg, etc for specific server configurations (ie Hardcore or Balanced Server mod)
Create a functional way to control/overwrite how a universe spawns
Create a scripting system for sectors that will allow for scripted events and commands to be executed when a player enters a new sector
Create a career system for players.  Different careers confer different abilities and they get.
better abilities as the career advances
Update Daemon functions to make use of the new file system

Some ideas feel free to add:

Add ability to turn off random ingame tips

Add ability to gather statistics for the server such as players on, size of directory, memory usage, player info, etc 
  to be used for access by other web applications or as a status display for a screen.

Add a web management panel

Add a mass export option to export all sectors with ships, stations, and planets for backup and restoration

Add a mission system and a career tally system (total pirate kills, total player kills, total ships created, etc) for careers so they can advance
